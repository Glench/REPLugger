REPLugger: a pleasant and scalable live code editor prototype
=============================================================

REPLugger is a research prototype code editor that integrates the features of a REPL and a debugger directly into the editing experience. **[See the 10 minute demo video here](https://youtu.be/F8p5bj01UWk).**

You can view [my website](http://glench.com) to see more of my projects. You can also sign up for my [UI Design for the Future of Programming newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/Flowsheets) to be updated about my research and analysis of programming.

A note: REPLugger is research code meant to demonstrate an idea, not to be well-engineered. You're probably better off trying to invent your own way of making the features possible than to figure out how I did it.
